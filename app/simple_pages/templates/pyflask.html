                The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries. Due to pytestâ€™s detailed assertion introspection, only plain assert statements are used.

        <p>We created HTML pages for the website. The main HTML page included a base template containing a navigation bar which has been called by all the other html page. All the pages are located in simple_pages/templates. These pages are styled using bootstrap templates. The prescense of these pages are checked by a python file called simple_pages_test.py located in /test directory. This test file asserts if the pages are present can checks if they are being loaded withot any HTML error.</p>
